LibAvoid Python bindings
========================

Building
--------
To build the Python bindings you should be able to build libavoid as described in the main README file.

To build the bindings you'll need to have Python installed. Also Cython <http://cython.org> is required. This package can be installed by hand or with the help of `easy_install` or `pip`.

Once Python and Cython are in place, simply build the bindings:

  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

or do a complete install:

  $ python setup.py install

To execute the test cases, use nose <..>:

  $ nosetests -v

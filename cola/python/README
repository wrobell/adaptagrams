LibAvoid Python bindings
========================

Building
--------
To build the Python bindings you should be able to build libavoid as described in the main README file.

To build the bindings you'll need to have Python installed. Also Cython <http://cython.org> is required. This package can be installed by hand or with the help of `easy_install` or `pip`.

Once Python and Cython are in place, simply build the bindings:

  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

or do a complete install:

  $ python setup.py install

To execute the test cases, use nose <..>:

  $ nosetests -v

Using libavoid Python bindings
------------------------------

The bindings have been Pythonized to some extend. This should make it more
intuitive for Python users to start using this library.

Changes wrt the C++ implementation:

* Point has been replaced by a tuple (x, y)

 We use gnu automake to build.  I've tried to make the contents of the
 repository as platform agnostic as possible, so you'll need to call
 aclocal, autoconf, and automake before configure.
 A somewhat transient dependency (depending on whether I include
 libcola/output_svg.cpp in the build) is Cairo (cairographics.org).
 It's only used by a few examples so you can easily build the core libraries
 without it.

run autogen.sh

to compile from scratch.
